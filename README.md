## *My Coding Journey* ##

# Introduction
Hello, everybody I am Minato and I am learning C++.
So, I chose C++ cause I wanna be a game dev. I know this is the most common goal children have but there are actually very few people who make their psasion a carrer and I wanna do that too.
I still have a long way ahead of me but everybdoy starts from zero.
