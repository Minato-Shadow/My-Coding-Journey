Hi👋, I’m Kushagra.

I’m currently learning C++.

I started coding because I was curious. I stayed because I liked the feeling of building something from nothing. I’ve tried a few other languages before, but C++ is the one that made me slow down and actually want to understand how things work.

Right now I’m focused on fundamentals. I don’t know everything, and I’m not trying to rush it. I’m just building small projects, making mistakes, fixing them, and getting a little better each time.

I’m interested in game🎮 development especially 2D games cause I like that old arcade feel, and I have dream of making the biggest 2D game of all time. I know it's not easy but it's not illegal to dream😅.

This GitHub is basically my progress log.
Some projects will be simple. Some might be messy.
But they’ll all be honest.

I’m still at the beginning. And I’m okay with that.
