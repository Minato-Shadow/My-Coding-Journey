## 🧠 what am I doing with my life?

I started coding at 13 because being average is not it 💀

right now i'm:
- 🧠 grinding C++ like it's a boss fight
- ⚙️ learning how memory works (segfaults hurt btw)
- 🧩 doing problem solving until my brain melts
- 🎮 secretly plotting to build a game someday
- 🚀 preparing for future FAANG villain arc

I don't just want to code.

I want someone to open my project and say:
"bro... YOU made this?? 🤯"

## 🛠 tech stack (for now...)

- 💻 C++
- 😭 debugging skills
- ☕ pure determination
